I am a master's student at McGill University, where I'm very fortunate to be advised by [](https://people.csail.mit.edu/rrw/)[﻿Prof. Yue Li](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~yueli/). Prior to that, I received my bachelor's degree from [Yao Class](http://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/yaoclass/) at Tsinghua University.

My research interests include computational healthcare, biomedical knowledge graph, graph representation learning, and topic modeling.
